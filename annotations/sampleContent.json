Yet, despite the fact that the Fed is once again in a holding pattern, the mood in the markets is anything but exuberant as earnings season on Wall Street begins next week.</p>\n<p>In a way it is tempting to argue that the Fed’s ongoing virtually zero interest rate policy has trumped sobering fundamentals and indeed that is surely part of the explanation of last week’s flows.</p>\n<p>But how much can the stock market rally in the face of the reality that earnings expectations have been steadily reduced? Analysts who last summer predicted earnings growth to come in at 12 per cent now anticipate a mere 2 per cent, Michael Cembalest of JPMorgan’s private bank notes. </p>\n<p>Indeed, “earnings growth is expected to be negative year over year in Q1 and Q2 as earnings weakness spreads beyond energy”, he adds. Meanwhile, average quarterly earnings growth in the universe of public issuers in the S&amp;P/LSTA Index, fell to its lowest level in the post-recession period in the third quarter of 2015, according to LCD Distressed Weekly.</p>\n<p>For profits to rebound, several things would have to happen. Unfortunately, none of them are likely to materialise any time soon. Moreover, many of them have to do with the Fed’s current stance and its expected actions in coming months.</p>\n<p>For example, a growing number of thoughtful observers expect that the Fed will actually embrace <content id=\"90ca12c0-d0b0-11e5-831d-09f7778e7377\" title=\"Why negative rates may dominate in 2016 - FT.com\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\">negative rates</content>, joining Japan and Europe in such a move. Recently, bank shares have been among the worst performing sectors, as net interest margins come under pressure. In addition, non-performing loans are expected to rise as a result of stress in the energy sector and in both related industries such as shipping and in unrelated industries such as retail and paper. Negative rates will only aggravate the pressure on the banks, making a rally in the shares of these financial institutions highly unlikely. Such a move would also hit insurers already struggling with low yields on their investment portfolios.</p>\n<p>Many analysts dismiss fears of a credit crunch, even as areas of distress in the economy increase — despite such low rates. But if the bond market cracks, the impact will be felt on banks and quickly transmitted to the real economy. The market is certainly vulnerable. In 2015, there was $209bn in high yield and leveraged loans (the bank market equivalent to junk bonds) with a credit rating of CCC or below — an all-time record. Covenant lite debt is also at an all-time high of 40 per cent of all such loans and 20 per cent trade at distressed levels as of mid-February, according to data from Oaktree Capital Management.</p>\n<a data-asset-type=\"video\" data-embedded=\"true\" href=\"http://video.ft.com/4814307777001\"></a>\n<br/>\n\n<p>It would also help if consumer spending picked up. But for the three months to the end of February, retail sales contracted 1.7 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis year over year, leading many analysts to lower their expectations for the whole year. Part of the reason may have to do with the fact that the pace of wage growth slowed once again in February — and it is difficult to earn anything on what gets saved from those wages. And if consumer spending isn’t stronger, why should business investment pick up?</p>\n<p>So far this year, the shiniest asset class in the investment firmament is gold — up 14.5 per cent. Mid-March marked the tenth week of inflows and a total of $12bn of inflows, the longest streak into gold since October of 2012, according to data from the Merrill Lynch unit of Bank of America.</p>\n<p>In the past such bullishness would reflect fear of inflation. Today, though, continuing deflation seems much more likely than inflation, with much of that deflation coming from a continuing <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/global-economy/china\" title=\"China economy news headlines - FT.com\">slowdown in China</a>, which means continued overproduction from state-owned enterprises and downward pressure on prices for everyone else. Part of the rally in gold is likely short-covering. But also the opportunity cost of holding gold compared with holding any other asset class has vanished. That, too, is a reflection of central bank actions. Is gold really a productive investment that will help kick-start growth?</p>\n<p>“Cash is trash,” analysts at Merrill argued. So is much else these days, sadly, including overly optimistic estimates of the future growth of the economy from the Fed.</p>\n</body>"
